    // By default all the configuration for optimization happens from the command
    // line or by properties in the config file, and configuration that was
    // passed to requirejs as part of the app's runtime "main" JS file is *not*
    // considered. However, if you prefer the "main" JS file configuration
    // to be read for the build so that you do not have to duplicate the values
    // in a separate configuration, set this property to the location of that
    // main JS file. The first requirejs({}), require({}), requirejs.config({}),
    // or require.config({}) call found in that file will be used.

    // a single file as the output, you can specify the module options inline,

    // mode to minify the code. Only available if running the optimizer using
    // Java.

    // in the minified files.
